## Implementation
This game was built as a part of Electronic Arts(EA)'s Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program. It is a modified version of the popular ___Pacman___ game.

The Pacman game was provided as a part of the program which you can find it here: [Github](https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman)

## Rules of the Game
> * VaxMan can kill enemies if it comes in contact with enemies  
>  * Enemies multiply every 30 seconds   
>  * The goal of the game is to collect all points before enemies grow 32 times which is 32* 4

## Steps Involved
1. Created a list for each type of enemy (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) which keeps track of all of its objects and movement
2. Created the main list which has all the list of enemies
3. Learned how to change some of the functions which can work with a list
4. Added the code which keeps track of time and multiplies the ghost every 30 seconds
5. Learned how to use pygame library 
  
## Future Prospects
 Develop more games using python and interact with different libraries
